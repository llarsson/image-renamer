# image-renamer
Finds the most recent image on an FTP server, downloads it and uploads it again as a specific file name. This rather odd way of doing it is required, since FTP does not have a native copy operation. The highly specific task is due to a webcam that uploads images directly to an FTP site, and we want to embed the latest picture on a web page.
